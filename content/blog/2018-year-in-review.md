# 2018 Year in review

### Stuff that I am happy about

##### First 10k and half marathon run

I completed my first 10 km and half marathon this year. It was a true test of my patience, determination and grit. I sure had to train for it and retrospectively, I know I did not train enough for it.

My legs pained a lot after the run but I am glad I could reach the finish line.

It made me think that running a marathon is similar to our life. Sure, there'll be obstacles in your path but the aim is to keep moving and approaching the goal. Progress matters more than the speed. There will always be people and system around you to support but it's you who will have to lift your feet, even if it's paining the most, and reach the finish line. Every level of pain is worth it when you reach the finish line.

#### Hero acquires stakes at Zenatix.

It's rewarding when others show confidence in you.

As a young kid, I have travelled a lot with my father on his road trips. Back in the days when we did not have the luxury of Google Maps, we used to stop by to ask people our way. There are always kind people who are willing to show you the path and put you in right direction.

I remember once an aged man, must be in his late forties showed us the direction to our destination. Our face sort of informed him that we needed more help than just the direction. He politely asked us if he can get on board and help us reach our destination. Hero Electronix, a 

### Stuff that I am not so happy about

### How did I spend most of my time at work

#### Hiring

We as a team spent a considerable amount of time in hiring. We could hire 5 awesome folks to our tech team.

#### Mentoring

I mentor 4 people at work. It's been a shift from a programmer in individual contributor role to manage and mentor a team of engineers. I believe it's a skill in itself to think broadly and have a larger vision to plan engineer effort accordingly. 

It wasn't something which came to me naturally and I struggled with it. I am thankful that I have great people at work who have been supportive and made my journey easier and worth while.

A year with no conferences

I took a deliberate break from attending conferences this year. Reason for those were generally lack of time to travel.

Transitioning from an engineer as an individual contributor to managing a team.

* As Zenatix grew, my team grew as well with it.

Hiring for the team

* It very different sitting on the other side of the table and hire.

Managing stress better.

Failures

Ive not been able to devote as much time to IoT Tales as I'd thought at all. This has been very upsetting. This is something which I have to change.
