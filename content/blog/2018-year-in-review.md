2018 year in review

# Year in review

When I planned to write this doc, I had to open up my Google Photos app to check what happened each month. 

It's been a year of roller coaster - professionally and personally. 

Hero acquires stakes at Zenatix.

A year with no conferences

 I took a deliberate break from attending conferences this year. Reason for those were generally lack of time to travel. 

 Transitioning from an engineer as an individual contributor to managing a team.

*   As Zenatix grew, my team grew as well with it. 

Hiring for the team

* It very different sitting on the other side of the table and hire. 

Managing stress better.

Delegation

Health 

1. Ive been more 

Failures

Ive not been able to devote as much time to IoT Tales as I'd thought at all. This has been very upsetting. This is something which I have to change.
