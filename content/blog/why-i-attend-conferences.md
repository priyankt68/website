Why to attend conferences and meetups ?

- Get inspired and inspire
    - If you’re attending an international conference, it’s highly likely that you’ll have super smart and awesome people attending and giving talks.  A word of advise here is that one should look at profiles of speakers to understand the theme of the conference. Here, looking at previous videos to understand the quality of the conference also could be helpful.
    - Another part of this is that you’ll have students attending the conference 

- Doubts clearance

- Network - Meet like-minded people (well, almost)
    - If it’s a technical conference, it’s fair to assume that it’ll 

Caution - All of these principles do not apply all kinds of conference and meetups. There are tons of conferences and meetups happening/occurring around the country on different domains, so choose your conferences wisely. Attending conferences, especially, is a big investment in terms of time and money. So act wisely. I am starting to follow a principle of attending 3 conferences in a year. I will share how it was like following this principle next year!
