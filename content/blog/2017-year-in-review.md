+++
This is my second attempt at year in review in type of articles. I did my first one last [year](https://medium.com/@priyankt68/2016-retrospective-798323add011) . 

The year has been good with few friends visiting over from abroad and it's always fun to have old friends visit you.

Conferences

I visited in a total of 4 conferences this year and was very satisfied with all of them. It started of with GopherCon India at Pune. It was my first Go conference and it turned out to be a great learning experience. I am still a beginner in Golang. I did give a talk I've blogged about my experience at [GopherCon](https://www.priyanktrivedi.org/blog/gopherconindia_2017_experience/) and [PyData Delhi](https://www.priyanktrivedi.org/blog/pydata-delhi-2017-recap/) in depth.

It volunteered at PyCon India and helped the team organise it. It is altogether a different experience attending a conference as a volunteer and a attendee. You get your deeply involved with the community organising it. PyCon India today has become a brand in itself. For me, it's not just another conference but a bonanza meetup of friends whom I only get to catch during PyCons. Since I was a part of the core organising committee, it helped me understand at a very deep level what it takes to pull off a conference of this size.

Work at Zenatix

It's been a year for what all of us at Zenatix had been waiting for.

Experience as a mentor

I have been mentoring two people at work and its's been a very liberating and learning experience.

Initially I was hesitant in taking up this role. This was essentially due to two reasons.

1. I wasn't sure if I was ready for it. My role had been more of an Individual Contributor - (I recently realised there exists a term for the role I was in). This essentially meant that I was individually taking up certain modules of the stack and building it in an out.
