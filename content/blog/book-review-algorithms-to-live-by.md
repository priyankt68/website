It’s a good blend of anecdotal evidence with intuition required for understanding the underlying algorithm in our day to day decision making

gives you a light dive into the algorithms related to computer networking and it’s evolution over the time. Why it evolved etc.

Also helps you understand the intuition behind the algorithms be it AIMD algorithm for congestion control in network flow or …

In a quest to explain the algorithms and relate them to daily lives, authors ensure that they do not force fit algorithms in our lives. For instance, they accept when they couldn’t really find a close match to sawtooth like behaviour of AIMD algorithm for network congestion control.

It can very well become a supplementary ready to undergraduate curriculum for computer science. Sure, it’ll make algorithms much more interesting. I say supplementary reading since I do not undermine the mathematical rigour that computer science textbooks teach.
