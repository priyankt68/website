[PyData Delhi 2017](https://pydata.org/delhi2017/) is the first conference organized by PyData Delhi chapter at IIIT Delhi. In fact, it’s one of the first PyData conferences in India.

I had a lot of fun and learned a lot over the two days of conference. Conferences are my way of taking a busy-break in my own way. I attend for workshops, talks, conference-friends-reunion and most importantly — the  hallway tracks.

Day 1 started with an awesome opening keynote by Siraj Raval on Mathematics behind Deep learning. Keynote was a good introduction with a walkthrough of a jupyter notebook. Here's a tweet about it.

I particularly enjoyed the live refactoring on stage by James Powell. James picked up a python code from Newton’s Fractal and refactored on the stage. The crux of refactoring involved around not using [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) as a dependency and still maintain the same performance. He attempted to attain it by utilizing [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) methods which are mostly unknown to programmers who do not understand ins and outs of numpy library. I believe that doing that sort of  refactoring live on stage is commendable. Post his talk, I had a good discussion around PyData community and how working professionals can contribute back to the community like PyData.

Key Project Takeaways

[Firefly ](http://github.com/rorodata/firefly/)— Firefly is a small library which exposes a function over an API. So essentially, one can call a function as one makes a API call over REST method. I’m definitely motivated to explore this sweet library further. Over the next one week, I would deep dive into the project to understand the components and perhaps blog about it as well.

[NetworkX ](https://networkx.github.io/)— In my discussions with James Powell, we discussed quite a few short comings of NetworkX. I am not particularly aware of all of them. It is something which I’m looking to explore. By the way, if you’re looking to learn NetworkX, I highly recommend taking up this [online course offered by DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/network-analysis-in-python-part-1).
