There are several things I do at conferences and meetups apart from listening to amazing talks. Enjoy sumptuous lunches. Making  “conference friends” - friends I meet only at conferences and later interact on Twitter!

There’s of course more to it. I ask questions. A lot. I try to interact with as many people as I can at a conference I attend. Thinking upon the kind of questions I ask, they generally fall into following categories:

One of the common doubts which people have is that what should I talk about to people I don’t know

Questions I ask to fellow attendees and speakers ?
        - Here are few questions that I generally ask
            - How does your day look like at your work place ?
            - Do you do anything specific to make yourself a better programmer
            - How do you manage your tasks or rather time-management to get the best output.
                - Rather a good question
            - How do you manage to refresh yourself when you feel that you’re burnt out.
            - If you’re talking to one of the speakers, following are some questions that I generally ask
                - How do you manage time to do you talk proposal and prepare for it ? (Assuming you’re really food since you’re proposing a talk or are invited to give one.)
                - How do you prepare your slides ? Do you have any specific themes around which you prepare your slides (minimalistic or full of examples or building a story )
	Such questions help me understand their perspective and how others are working, doing similar kind of work. The idea is to not copy-paste the ideas shared by others but more so to understand what ones suit you the most.

Questions for sponsors
	- This is one of the most important things I do at conferences. Sponsors are an integral part of community driven conferences like PyCon India conferences, GopherCon India conferences. Most companies sponsor from a hiring perspective. I visit their booths to ask following questions (apart from accepting goodies from them)
- What’s their tech-stack ?
- What’s their hiring process
    - This is important not only if you want to get but also if you wish to understand the hiring process that you can follow.

- Meet the sponsors
