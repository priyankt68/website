This blog post is an introduction to different components of Ansible - an automation tool that I am using at Zenatix to automate some of the DevOps stuff. It's a pretty useful tool and has been very helpful to me. I needed something really simple and that's why I opted for Ansible. 

### So What's Ansible ?

Ansible is an automation system. With Ansible, you can handle configurations, perform ad-hoc commands across your servers, copy files to-and-fro from your machines. Tool like Ansible completely takes away the effort of writing custom scripts to perform trivial tasks to be orchestrated across your architecture.
