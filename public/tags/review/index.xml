      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s again that time of the year when I reflect back on the year gone by. It&amp;rsquo;s a useful exercise. It helps me put things in perspective. It does also make me feel as if so little have I achieved in this previous year but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter eventually. Each one of us is trying their best. If one knows that they&amp;rsquo;ve put their honest effort to the best they can, I think that&amp;rsquo;s what really matters.</description>

      <description>I attended PyData Delhi 2017 over this weekend which was the first conference organized by PyData Delhi chapter at IIIT Delhi. In fact, itâ€™s one of the first PyData conferences in India. If you wish to be a part of the community, join the meetup group.&amp;nbsp; 
The conference was organised at the beautiful campus of IIIT Delhi.
 I had a lot of fun and learned a lot over the two days of conference.</description>
