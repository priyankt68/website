      <description>I attended PyData Delhi 2017 over this weekend which was the first conference organized by PyData Delhi chapter at IIIT Delhi. In fact, itâ€™s one of the first PyData conferences in India. If you wish to be a part of the community, join the meetup group.&amp;nbsp; 
The conference was organised at the beautiful campus of IIIT Delhi.
 I had a lot of fun and learned a lot over the two days of conference.</description>
